= Translations =

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.5 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our product catalog plugin and uploading it to your web-server via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the product catalog pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
